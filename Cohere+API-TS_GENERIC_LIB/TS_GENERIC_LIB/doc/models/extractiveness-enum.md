# Extractiveness Enum

One of `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `auto`, defaults to `auto`. Controls how close to the original text the summary is. `high` extractiveness summaries will lean towards reusing sentences verbatim, while `low` extractiveness summaries will tend to paraphrase more. If `auto` is selected, the best option will be picked based on the input text.
